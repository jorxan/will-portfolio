If I liked a new idea more, it had to be good enough to justify leaving behind all the work preceding it.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"design__iterations\">\n                    <div className=\"iterations__header\">\n                        <h1>\n                            Iterations + <br/>\n                            Prototypes\n                        </h1>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <p>\n                        What started with a couple ideas, eventually became a dozen more that I wanted to explore further.  Even with one week to work, I managed to go in depth in 3 separate styles, before committing to my final design.  It did cause unnecessary challenges but made for a better product overall since I used elements from each iteration.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                {/* Versions */}\n                <div className=\"version\">\n                    <div>\n                        <h1>\n                            V1\n                        </h1>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"version__columnR\">\n                    <div className=\"version__list\">\n                        <ul>\n                        <li>Wanted to play around with an open-faced cover that was interactive with the art.</li>\n                        <li>A spotlight for each important musical character and their instruments.</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"version__image\">\n                        <img src={V1} alt=\"\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"version\">\n                    <div>\n                        <h1>\n                            V2\n                        </h1>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"version__columnR\">\n                    <div className=\"version__list\">\n                        <ul>\n                        <li>Tried to bring the spotlight out from the inside covers and in to the cover (still interactive).</li>\n                        <li>Couldn't make this design work with other covers.</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"version__image\">\n                        <img src={V2} alt=\"\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"version\">\n                    <div>\n                        <h1>\n                            V3\n                        </h1>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"version__columnR\">\n                    <div className=\"version__list\">\n                        <ul>\n                        <li>After spending too much energy into my first 2 designs I wanted to go in a completely different direction.</li>\n                        <li>Started abstracting characters in to significant items throughout the movie.

(V1, V2) <br/>\n                        Soon realizing that each important scene in the movie had Joe interacting with someone in conflict, and it always had some item tied to it. I refer to them as the \"pocket dump\" items from the climax of the movie. The Pizza Crust, Metro Card, Bagel, Lollipop, Spool, and Flower Pedal. Using those items in my designs became the main priority. (V3-Final) For the back cover, there was a scene where Joe is walking through his hall of memories and sees a pedestal with some embarrassing items, and now as a changed soul I wanted to replace those with what he values now.\n                        </p>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"deliverables__finalImage\">\n                        <img src={Final} alt=\"\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"takeaways\">\n                        <div className=\"takeaways__title\">\n                            <h1>Takeaways</h1>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"takeaways__content\">\n                            <p>\n                                Unexpected time-crunches are a very real thing that happen in every day situations.
